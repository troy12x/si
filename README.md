# SI-Core / QuasarV4 Language Model

A novel language model architecture focusing on dynamic neural state evolution and graph-based memory.

## Features

- Non-transformer architecture with continuous neural dynamics
- Graph-based memory system
- Dynamic concept activation and composition
- Low-compute requirements
- Style and personality preservation

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from si_core.model import SI_Core
from si_core.utils import TextEncoder

# Initialize model
model = SI_Core()

# Process input
response = model.process_input("What is the capital of France?")
print(f"Response: {response}")
```
